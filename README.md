# Spud the Frenchie

This is a simple landing page introducing Spud the Frenchie. This project is to demonstrate and practice the skills I've learned in The Odin Project's CSS portion under the Foundations path. I focused mainly on using flexboxes and its properties, such as flex-wrap, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, alignments and more to style the layout.
